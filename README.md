# AI Safety Incident Log API

## Description

A RESTful API for logging and managing AI safety incidents, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This API allows users to log incidents related to AI safety, retrieve all incidents, fetch a specific incident by ID, and delete incidents from the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime to build the backend.
- **Express**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing AI safety incidents.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**
2. **MongoDB**

cd ai-safety-incident-log-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash

```

### 3. Create a .env File
Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your MongoDB URI like this:
